0.999032 2009-08-02 22:39:00

  - The page cache plugin was caching the empty body before a redirect, and
    then using that for further requests of the same page. Arguably, this is a
    bug in PageCache, but for now it is fixed here. (Dave Rolsky)

  - Logging out of a wiki which did not allow anonymous viewing left the user
    able to view the last page they were on. Now they are immediately taken to
    the login screen. (Dave Rolsky)

  - Reorganized the navigation menus to try to group site-wide and
    page-specific options together. Top-level menu links (like Recent and
    Tags) are now always site-wide. For path-specific versions, go to the "Sub
    pages" view of a path.  (Dave Rolsky)

  - The gallery link was broken (Dave Rolsky)

  - Redesigned the attachments list as a nicely formatted table. Images now
    include a thumbnail preview, and the actions available for each attachment
    are context-sensitive based on the type of attachment and user
    permissions. (Dave Rolsky)

  - Attachments are now viewable without going to the edit form first (Dave
    Rolsky)

  - The "insert link" option for an attachment went to a slightly broken
    version of the edit form (Dave Rolsky)

    all settings (Dave Rolsky)

  - MojoMojo warns on startup if mojomojo_spawn_db.pl was not run, and all
    requests return a 404 (mateu)

  - A newly created database now has an anonymous user preference set. Without
    this, anonymous users are not supported properly (Dave Rolsky)

  - Recent changes now shows users' names, not their logins (Dave Rolsky)

  - The users list in the admin section only showed the first 20 users. Added
    paging links so you can browse all of them. (Dave Rolsky)

  - The users list now shows active users first (Dave Rolsky)

  - A user's active flag is now shown as "yes" or "no" in the UI (Dave Rolsky)

  - Fixed markup inserted by edit toolbar buttons for images and links (dandv)

  - The edit page incorrectly labeled a button "Create and View" for a page
    that only had one revision, when it should have been labeled "Save and
    View" (Dave Rolsky)

  - In edit mode, the preview & form should now always fit in the browser
    viewport together without scrolling, in both horizontal & vertical split
    modes. (Dave Rolsky)

  - Revised MultiMarkdown syntax help tips (Dave Rolsky)

  - Removed the page delete action, which was broken with PostgreSQL, and not
    checking permissions. This will come back in a better form in the future
    (Dave Rolsky)

  - HTML entities are now escaped in code blocks and "# comments" are rendered
    correctly in Perl syntax blocks (GitHub issues #41, #11) (dandv)

  - Textile no longer converts non-ASCII characters into HTML entities (dandv)

  - Fixed Catalyst theme so that Save buttons are visible (dandv)

  - All methods are documented in POD with =head2 instead of =item, so that
    they appear in the module's TOC. Uniform LICENSE for all modules. (dandv)

  - Major documentation updates to Prefs.pod, Schema::Result*::Page*,
    Formatter/WRITING YOUR OWN FORMATTER, (dandv)

  - Reformatted Changes, but you probably noticed that by now (dandv)

  - Move some settings into MojoMojo.pm to make mojomojo.conf more
    friendly. (marcus)
